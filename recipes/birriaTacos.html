                        <p class="paragraph one">Birria is a traditional Mexican dish from the state of Jalisco made from slow-cooked fall-apart juicy and tender beef in a rich and flavorful red chile broth, or consomé.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph two">It’s traditionally cooked for special occasions, holidays, weddings, parties, and even baptisms, but it has become so incredibly popular on social media that it can be found everywhere nowadays!</p>
                            
                        <p class="paragraph three">It’s usually enjoyed as a savory stew served with toppings like cilantro, onions, and freshly squeezed lime juice or served as tacos with lots of melted cheese, aka quesabirria tacos!</p>

                           <li>Season & sear meat
                                <p>Season your meat on both sides with salt and pepper. Then set a Dutch oven over medium-high heat with olive oil. Add the meat and sear on all sides until browned. You might need to work in two batches. Once all meat is seared, set aside.</p></li>
                           <li>Soak the chiles
                                <p>In a medium pot, add all of the dried chiles, tomatoes, onion, cinnamon stick, bay leaves, and peppercorns, covering everything completely with water. Bring this to a boil, then lower the heat, cover, and cook for 10 minutes.</p></li>
                           <li>Blend
                                <p>Once the chiles are softened, transfer everything to a blender and add 1 cup of chile-soaked water. Add in the broth, vinegar, and the remaining spices. Blend until smooth, about 5 minutes.</p></li>
                           <li>Cook
                                <p>Strain the blended sauce into the pot with the seared meat (if necessary, depending on the power of your blender), gently stir, and bring to a boil. Bring heat to low, cover, and cook for 3-3 ½ hours, until meat is fall-apart tender.</p></li>
                            <li>Shred
                                <p>Take the meat out to shred, and add shredded meat back to consome.</p></li>
                            <li>Serve!!!
                                <p>Birria can be enjoyed in a lot of ways which is the best part of making it! Whichever way you choose to enjoy your birria, make sure to dip it into the consome or enjoy it as a stew with plenty of that broth.</p>
